## 💡 **Pro Tips for Using Finalization Prompts**

### **✅ DO:**

1. **Work systematically** - Don't jump around randomly
2. **Test on real devices** - Simulators miss real-world issues
3. **Document everything** - Create checklists as you go
4. **Get fresh eyes** - Have someone else test the site
5. **Use multiple browsers** - Safari especially needs testing
6. **Prioritize mobile** - 50%+ of traffic is mobile for most sites
7. **Measure performance** - Before and after metrics matter
8. **Take your time** - Finalization can't be rushed
9. **Test user flows** - End-to-end journey testing is critical
10. **Iterate based on findings** - First pass reveals issues

### **❌ DON'T:**

1. **Don't skip mobile testing** - It's not optional
2. **Don't test only on your device** - Test across device types
3. **Don't ignore performance** - Speed = conversions
4. **Don't over-animate** - Subtle is better than flashy
5. **Don't forget accessibility** - It's legal requirement + good UX
6. **Don't assume links work** - Test every single one
7. **Don't launch without SEO** - Hard to fix later
8. **Don't skip cross-browser testing** - Users use different browsers
9. **Don't ignore errors** - Fix every console error
10. **Don't finalize alone** - Get feedback from others
